# Dog vs Cat Image Classifier using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

This project demonstrates the development of a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network to classify images of dogs and cats.  
It adopts a **foundational machine learning approach** using `scikit-learn`, focusing on data preprocessing, model architecture evaluation, and performance tuning.

## Project Highlights
- **Model Development** → Implemented an MLP neural network using `MLPClassifier` from scikit-learn.  
- **Architecture Evaluation** → Analyzed how varying hidden layers, neuron counts, and activation functions (ReLU, Tanh) affect performance.  
- **Data Preprocessing** → Applied **image flattening** for pixel-based inputs and **feature scaling** to standardize data.  
- **Performance Tuning** → Enhanced generalization using **noise augmentation** to make the model more robust on unseen images.
